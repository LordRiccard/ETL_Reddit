I remember teachers saying voltage is like the “pressure” that makes the electrons want to move, and that current/amperage is like the speed at which the electrons are moving. But I don’t know if I remembered it right because I’m my totally uninformed brain, it makes more sense for current/amps to be the actual amount of free electrons moving in the circuit.   For example, it’s high amperage that melts wires and pops fuses. To me that would make sense that what’s generating all that heat is that there’s a high amount of electrons actually in that current flow generating all the heat. I don’t see why the speed at which an electron flows would be why the wire melts or the fuse pops for example.  And then my other piece of logic that I have but I don’t think is actually right, is that in my head, it wouldn’t make sense for current/amps to be the speed at which the electrons move, because otherwise how does a High voltage low amperage circuit work? Like, assuming I am wrong and amperage is the speed at which electrons flow, I don’t see how you could have a circuit with extremely high voltage, big potential difference, lots of “pressure” forcing the electrons to move, but then also being a low amp circuit where at the same time, those electrons are moving very slowly. It doesn’t make sense to me. If the potential difference of electrons is very high then why would they flow slowly if you know what I mean? For examples sake a 24 volt circuit and a current flow of 2 amps. That’s what’s tripping me up and making me think amperage is how many electrons are actually flowing.

Why is it that x+0/y+0 and x+5/y+5 don't have the same difference as x+100/y+100 and x+105/y+105, even though both additive numbers have the difference of 5?  &#x200B;  Let me do an example. Let's say x and y were both 0. Let's skip the math, the answer is obviously 0. Then, let's say they were both 5. So, 5+5=10 -> 10/2=5 -> 5\^2=25  Then let's say x and y were both 100. So, 100+100=200 -> 200/2=100 -> 100\^2=10,000. Then, let's say x and y were 105. 105+105=210 -> 210/2=105 -> 105\^2=11,025  25-0 is 25, but 11,025-10,000 is 1,025.

This is quite hard for me to wrap my head around. I have questions around this and never got the right perspective. If a physicist can explain this like I am five, that would be amazing.  So, if time stops for light, from light's perspective, it must feel as if it's staying still at one place, right? Because if it moves, there must be a time axis involved. If this is true then every light beam that ever originated has been at the same place at the same time. If those photons have minds of their own, then they would be experiencing absolutely no progress, while everything else around it is evolving in their own time. That would also mean light sees everything happening around it instantly and forever. And the light's own existence is instantaneous. Am I making sense? In that case, a beam that originated at point A reaches its destination of point B instantly, from its perspective, despite the distance. But We see it having a certain finite velocity, since we observe light from an alternate dimension? It's a crazy thought that I have been grappling with.

It would logically follow then, that the way to diagnose such illnesses is to measure the level of these neurotransmitters in the brain and compare them to normal levels, basically like any other disease is diagnosed.  However, this is not the case for mental illnesses. They are diagnosed via the often unreliable method of assessing symptoms and eliminating other causes. Why is that the case? Are there no ways to measure neurotransmitter levels in the brain or do we not have enough information on the ""normal"" amounts of these hormones?  Thanks in advance!

This heat escapes the building and to the outside. Where would the energy go next and what would its next form be?   Searching on the internet for an answer gave another ‘where does the energy go’ thought - the example given was a car with stored chemical energy, which is then converted into kinetic energy via the engine to move the car.

Im going to be explaining and asking questions with respect to an NPN transistor: Here is my current understanding (pun intended):  1. NPN at off state 2. We apply a small biasing voltage Vbe that makes the base emitter junction forward biased 3. Electrons flow from the emitter into the base where some of them recombine and flow through to the base lead (this causes a small  base current).  4. The rest of the electrons pass through the base collector junction and end up in the collector (leads to a collector current) Now here I dont really get how the base current is controlling this larger collector current. My initial thought was that increasing the base emitter voltage leads to more electrons successfully recombining with the holes, as such allowing more electrons to bypass the P type base.   However in this case the changes in the collector current would be the same as the changes in the base current and not necessarily proportional. So how exactly does this base current control the collector current in a proportional manner?
