I'm trying to understand, is Lake Michigan actually so much more dangerous than the Pacific, or is it just a culture thing or is there a difference I don't understand...?  I grew up around the ocean, surfing for 15 years, snorkeling, skim boarding, swimming... as deep/far out as you want to go. Lifeguards, no lifeguards... whatever.

I remember teachers saying voltage is like the “pressure” that makes the electrons want to move, and that current/amperage is like the speed at which the electrons are moving. But I don’t know if I remembered it right because I’m my totally uninformed brain, it makes more sense for current/amps to be the actual amount of free electrons moving in the circuit.   For example, it’s high amperage that melts wires and pops fuses. To me that would make sense that what’s generating all that heat is that there’s a high amount of electrons actually in that current flow generating all the heat. I don’t see why the speed at which an electron flows would be why the wire melts or the fuse pops for example.  And then my other piece of logic that I have but I don’t think is actually right, is that in my head, it wouldn’t make sense for current/amps to be the speed at which the electrons move, because otherwise how does a High voltage low amperage circuit work? Like, assuming I am wrong and amperage is the speed at which electrons flow, I don’t see how you could have a circuit with extremely high voltage, big potential difference, lots of “pressure” forcing the electrons to move, but then also being a low amp circuit where at the same time, those electrons are moving very slowly. It doesn’t make sense to me. If the potential difference of electrons is very high then why would they flow slowly if you know what I mean? For examples sake a 24 volt circuit and a current flow of 2 amps. That’s what’s tripping me up and making me think amperage is how many electrons are actually flowing.  I don’t know which one is right or if it’s some combination of the two or something so I’d appreciate someone dumbing it down to my level!",11,Physics,1742636286.0

Let's say I have an equation, ((x+y)÷2)\^2. Why is it that x+0/y+0 and x+5/y+5 don't have the same difference as x+100/y+100 and x+105/y+105, even though both additive numbers have the difference of 5?  &#x200B;  Let me do an example. Let's say x and y were both 0. Let's skip the math, the answer is obviously 0. Then, let's say they were both 5. So, 5+5=10 -> 10/2=5 -> 5\^2=25  Then let's say x and y were both 100. So, 100+100=200 -> 200/2=100 -> 100\^2=10,000. Then, let's say x and y were 105. 105+105=210 -> 210/2=105 -> 105\^2=11,025  25-0 is 25, but 11,025-10,000 is 1,025. Why is the difference not the same, even though in both cases, only 5 was added to each side?  I know this is shit you learn in like middle school lol but idk, it's what time does to someone ig. The math itself is relatively intuitive to me, but the reasoning behind it is what's getting me  &#x200B;  Edit: I think I pretty much get it now.

Here all books are expensive when you take the median income into account; uni textbooks are expensive, but not more than any other kind of book with a similar size and amount of pages.  Even then, few students can actually afford original textbooks, so we usually end up using photocopies. It is technically illegal, but since there are no other viable alternatives, copyright doesn't get enforced. Additionally, universities themselves (both public and private) often hand out PDFs of books for the students to print out; you can usually get them printed and binded in the univesity campus or a nearby copy shop  So, I can't really understand why don't more students make photocopies of the textbooks they have to use.

This is quite hard for me to wrap my head around. I have questions around this and never got the right perspective. If a physicist can explain this like I am five, that would be amazing.  So, if time stops for light, from light's perspective, it must feel as if it's staying still at one place, right? Because if it moves, there must be a time axis involved. If this is true then every light beam that ever originated has been at the same place at the same time. If those photons have minds of their own, then they would be experiencing absolutely no progress, while everything else around it is evolving in their own time. That would also mean light sees everything happening around it instantly and forever. And the light's own existence is instantaneous. Am I making sense? In that case, a beam that originated at point A reaches its destination of point B instantly, from its perspective, despite the distance.

I am also confused on when you have to different materials  like copper had a specific heat of 0.385 J/g°C  when you compare it with water (4.184 J/g°C)  As water had higher specific heat capacity it needs more ""heat"" to increase temperature and ""store"" it.

I remembered back to physics - and perhaps I’m remembering it wrong, but energy can’t be created or destroyed, just transferred. So my thought process went along the lines of stored energy in gas is transferred to the water causing it to heat. Thermal energy in the water escapes and enters the room. This heat escapes the building and to the outside. Where would the energy go next and what would its next form be?   Searching on the internet for an answer gave another ‘where does the energy go’ thought - the example given was a car with stored chemical energy, which is then converted into kinetic energy via the engine to move the car. Where does this energy then go?   Edit - Thanks for all the answers! Today I learnt that heat is the lowest form of energy and often considered ‘used’ when converted to heat.

Im going to be explaining and asking questions with respect to an NPN transistor: Here is my current understanding (pun intended):  1. NPN at off state 2. We apply a small biasing voltage Vbe that makes the base emitter junction forward biased 3. Electrons flow from the emitter into the base where some of them recombine and flow through to the base lead (this causes a small  base current).  4. The rest of the electrons pass through the base collector junction and end up in the collector (leads to a collector current) Now here I dont really get how the base current is controlling this larger collector current. My initial thought was that increasing the base emitter voltage leads to more electrons successfully recombining with the holes, as such allowing more electrons to bypass the P type base.   However in this case the changes in the collector current would be the same as the changes in the base current and not necessarily proportional. So how exactly does this base current control the collector current in a proportional manner? Thanks again for your help guys!",3,Engineering,1742031629.0

How is it different from a genuine mistake?  I can mistake one word for another and I think it's very common. It happened to me in silly situations like accidentally saying I will apply a face cream first and then wash my face even though I wanted to do it in the opposite order. It doesn't mean I secretly planned to change the order. One time I was talking with one person about one product for a long time and then that person asked for it in a shop accidentally instead of asking for the thing she wanted. It doesn't mean anything either. She just had it in her mind because it was a subject of our conversation a few minutes ago.  What's the difference between that and a Freudian slip? On the outside they both appear identical to me. Only the speaker knows which one was that.,3,Other,1741855577.0
